# Newsworthy Events and Web Research

When family members or tracked individuals are affected by significant public events (weather, local news, etc.), verify and link to trusted sources rather than creating artifacts.

---

## When This Applies

- User mentions a newsworthy event (storm, local incident, school closure, community event)
- Event has public news coverage that provides context or verification
- Event impacts family members' activities or timelines
- User wants to document an event that affected their day/plans

---

## The Goal

Provide verified, factual context for events by linking to trusted, politically neutral news sources. Links serve as:
- Verification of event details (dates, severity, impact)
- Context for future reference ("Why was the escape room cancelled?")
- Primary sources rather than secondary summaries

This follows the philosophy: enrich incomplete data and validate information, but don't create artifacts when a source already exists.

## How to Think About It

**Search for trusted, neutral sources.** When a newsworthy event is mentioned:
1. Use WebSearch to find coverage from:
   - Local news stations (ABC, NBC, CBS affiliates)
   - Regional newspapers
   - National Weather Service (for weather events)
   - Government agencies (for public safety events)
2. Prioritize sources that are:
   - Factual and descriptive
   - Politically neutral
   - Local/regional when possible
   - Official when available (NWS, school district, city government)

**Link, don't save.** The web is the permanent record. Your role:
- Find the authoritative source
- Extract the URL
- Reference it in the timeline/memory
- Include key facts (date, impact, outcomes)

**Verify before documenting.** Search to confirm:
- Event dates and timing
- Severity/impact details
- Cancellations or closures mentioned
- How it affected the person's activities

**Context matters.** Include enough detail so future-you understands:
- Why plans changed
- What the conditions were
- How the person adapted

## Watch Out For

**Biased or partisan sources.** Avoid:
- Opinion pieces
- Sources with clear political leanings
- Sensationalized coverage
- Social media as primary sources

**Over-documenting minor events.** Not every mention of weather needs a news link. Apply judgment:
- **Do link**: Major storms, school closures, significant disruptions
- **Don't link**: "It was raining" or "Nice day outside"

**Creating artifacts when links suffice.** Don't write a news article when you can link to one. Exception: If no good source exists and the event is significant to the person's story, then a brief artifact is appropriate.

**Outdated or incorrect information.** Verify:
- Publication dates match the event
- Details align with what the user described
- Links aren't behind paywalls (prefer open sources)

## Examples

**Good: Weather event with impact**
> User: "Owen and Asa shoveled driveways today. Huge snow storm."
> Claude: *Searches "snow storm [location] January 25 2026"*
> Claude: *Finds National Weather Service report and local news coverage*
> Claude: *Adds to timeline: "Shoveling driveways with Asa (major snow storm - [link to NWS/local news])"*

**Good: Event cancellation due to news**
> User: "The escape room was cancelled because of the weather."
> Claude: *Already has weather link from previous context*
> Claude: *Updates timeline: "Ari's birthday party moved from escape room to home due to snow storm ([link])"*

**Good: School closure**
> User: "No school today because of icy roads."
> Claude: *Searches "[school district name] closure January 2026"*
> Claude: *Finds school district announcement or local news*
> Claude: *Adds: "Snow day - school closed due to icy conditions ([link to district announcement])"*

**Bad: No search performed**
> User: "Owen and Asa shoveled driveways today. Huge snow storm."
> Claude: *Adds to timeline: "Shoveling driveways with Asa during a huge snow storm"*
> ❌ Missing: verification and link to trusted source

**Bad: Creating artifact instead of linking**
> User: "There was a big storm."
> Claude: *Writes a fake news article about the storm*
> ❌ Should have searched for and linked to real coverage

**Bad: Using biased source**
> User: "School board meeting was intense."
> Claude: *Links to partisan blog post about the meeting*
> ❌ Should have found official minutes or neutral local news coverage

**Good: No link needed (not newsworthy)**
> User: "Owen had a playdate with Felix, they played video games."
> Claude: *Adds to timeline without news search*
> ✓ Regular playdate doesn't need verification

## Integration with Other Skills

- **Entity Verification**: Search for newsworthy events follows the same principle — verify before capturing, research before asking
- **Dictation Processing**: When processing dictations mentioning events, enrich with web research when valuable
- **Person Intelligence**: Timeline entries benefit from source links for context and credibility
